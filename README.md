#Beerfest
One of the biggest issues I've found at beer fests that I've attended is that it's hard to keep track of what you've sampled. At an event like the American Craft Beer Fest in Boston, for example, there are well over 650 beers in attendance from over 150 different breweries. My goal is to provide that tracking mechanism.
